                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> This article only showed some different designs of animation after user interaction. The animations are used to bring the user's attention to certain things. They are also used to maintain engagement. </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I liked going through the designs to see how the animations brought my attention to important things on the website/app. It makes the design fun to look at. I liked that there were no explanations so the reader can analyze the designs themselves.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> I liked the last one the most, Midnight Hour. I liked the choice of colors, it looks different than most websites I've seen. The design is simple and also minimalistic. There's not much that distracts the viewer from its main content, however if the figure remains on the screen the whole entire time, it can be unsettling to some.</p>

                            <p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? Please briefly explain why.</p>
                            <p> 8. I liked how the content is shown different than the usual article's we've read. </p>
