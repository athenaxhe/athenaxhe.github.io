				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> Dark Patterns are UX/UI designs created with hidden ulterior motives. The designers know how humans will see and interact with the interface and use that to their advantage to hide information. For this to end, it all comes down to the morality of the designers. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part was the examples that the author provided. The author explained the type of Dark Pattern and included a real life example, even the ones that they've personally experienced. It was interesting to see that there were so many ways of deception, common enough so that there are terms for them. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> "I believe that as user experience designers we need to think beyond providing aesthetics and usability to our users. We help shape the lives of people everywhere and our decisions can have significant impacts on the way we as a society behave." </p>
					</li>
