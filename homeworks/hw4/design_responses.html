					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Products must be color accessible because people with visual impairments may not see the content. Don't rely only on color, use visuals like icons to draw attention/show information on websites. Make sure websites can be navigated with a keyboard. Overall, make your website accessible and inclusive.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I liked how the author gave examples on how to make your website accessible. It was interesting to learn about using messaging or iconography to visually emphasize important information, and that websites should be navigable with keyboards. The color scheme of the website should be documented for teams to keep the website uniform. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "As designers, developers, and general tech people, we have the power to create a web we're all proud of: an inclusive web made for and consumable by all people." </p>
