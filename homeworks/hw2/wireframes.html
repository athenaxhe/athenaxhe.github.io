					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Using the favorite website you chose in homework 1, create a wireframe for one page of it using pen/paper, PowerPoint, or any your tool of choice. (use the 'img' tag!) Make sure to let us know what the name of your website is (Use the 'p' tag!)</p>
							<p> Netflix </p>
							<img src="assets/imgs/Wireframe.pdf" />
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Try to improve the website you've chosen, and create a redesigned wireframe of one page for the same website using the principles of visual hierarchy that you learned from the article.</p>
							<img src="assets/imgs/Wireframe2.pdf" />
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Responses</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is the goal of the website? Who is it intended for? How does the design accomplish this? Write 2-3 sentences answering these questions. (Use the 'p' tag again!)</p>
							<p> The goal of the website is to attract new customers and signing up for a subscription. It is intended for people who want to watch shows/movies on demand. The design is simple and gets to the point, 
								there is a place where they can put in their email addresses to sign up and it also shows the highlights of their services.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Write 2-3 sentences about what problems your redesign addressed, and how it solved them.</p>
							<p> Honestly, I liked the website and didn't really find much to redesign. The website is simple and clear, it shows what is important and emphasizes words that have a larger impact. 
								My only thought is that the front is a little crowded, the background makes the words slightly hard to see so I would make the background around the words darker. Additionally, 
								they could add shows on their website that are only available on Netflix. </p>
						</li>
						<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure to include the wireframe images in the website and don't just put it in your assets folder!</p></li>
						<p>Your wireframes should look something like this:</p>
				<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/wireframe.png"/>
