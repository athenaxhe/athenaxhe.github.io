        <p>I am a transfer student from the Bay Area. I'm a competitive swimmer and was on the swim team from my previous college. 
            I used to ski, ice skate, and dance as well. I'm constantly listening to music and looking for new songs. I also enjoy word 
            games like Wordle, Anagrams, and Word Hunt. </p>

            <li>I learned that you can't just use what looks good on a website, you have to design it in a way to maximize its use. Specific wording is used to encourage interaction.</li>
            <li>My favorite part of the article is where the author broke down parts of popular apps' designs. Showed what was emphasized and important to the use of the app. </li>
            <li>"By routinely analyzing other apps, you'll develop your product thinking and get better at designing apps yourself."</li>
