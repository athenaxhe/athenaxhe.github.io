						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>The way objects are animated are important. Speed and order matters, depending on the object's function and what to draw attention to. The movements of objects must also reflect the movement of the real world, natural movements.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>I liked the animations provided to visualize the explanations. The differences shown in "good" animations and "bad" animations are helpful. I also liked how the examples given are from what we would see regularly and not notice, one being the different speeds used for its respective screen size.</p>
